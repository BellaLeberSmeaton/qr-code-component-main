## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project was a great exercise to test my flex-box learnings. Establishing the `height: 100vh` for centering horizontally and vertically with Flexbox was important in concluding this project.

Remembering flex-box on the outer container:

```css
body {
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
  max-width: 375px;
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  margin: 20px auto;
}
```

### Continued development

There are two areas I will be applying further development to:

- rem / em / and viewports
- flexbox and when to apply to parent - child.

### Useful resources

- [Better Dev resource](https://www.better.dev/centering-things-with-css-flexbox) - This helped me decide how I was going to apply flex-box with vertical and horizontal placement.
